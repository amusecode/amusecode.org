## Online user meetings

We organise biweekly user meetings, alternating between Friday afternoon and Friday mornings (European time).
The user meetings are open to all AMUSE users, from beginners to experts.
They are an excellent opportunity to ask us anything you wanted to know about AMUSE, from installation issues to advanced bridging methods.

These meetings and other AMUSE related events are announced on Github: [https://github.com/amusecode/amuse/discussions/categories/events](https://github.com/amusecode/amuse/discussions/categories/events)

## In-person meetings

We (irregularly) organise in-person meetings, either in the form of a workshop or as a school.
These are organised at varying levels, with aims of teaching how to use AMUSE, contributing to AMUSE or usually a combination.

### Recent meetings:

- June 2022: AMUSE school at University of Geneva, Switzerland
