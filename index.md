## Welcome to AMUSE

AMUSE is the Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment.

With it, you can simulate many astrophysical systems.

### Getting Started

The easiest way to use AMUSE is to install it with pip - see [installation](https://amuse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/index.html).
1. Install Python and other prerequisites, such as a compiler and MPI.
2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment.
3. Install AMUSE via pip.
4. Done! Try some of the examples if you like.

We also encourage you to register to the AMUSE announcements list at [https://groups.google.com/g/amusecode/about](https://groups.google.com/g/amusecode/about).

### Documentation

You can find the documentation [here](https://amuse.readthedocs.io). Additions and/or updates to the documentation
are appreciated, the source is in the github repository [tree](https://github.com/amusecode/amuse/tree/master/doc).

### Examples

AMUSE comes with many examples, which you can find in the ["examples" directory on github](https://github.com/amusecode/amuse/tree/master/examples).
The "textbook" examples are described in the [AMUSE book](https://iopscience.iop.org/book/978-0-7503-1320-9).

### Get involved

AMUSE is a community effort, and we very much appreciate contributions.
If you know of a simulation program you think would be a good addition to AMUSE, or if you wrote one yourself, please let us know and we'd be very happy to help write an AMUSE interface for it.
Please do also contact us if you want to fix a bug, add a feature or do something else to contribute!
