[![AMUSE simulation of the triple star Xi Taurus](http://img.youtube.com/vi/oW5lo4f9NL0/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW5lo4f9NL0 "AMUSE simulation of the triple star Xi Taurus")

Evolution of the triple star system Xi Tau in the constellation
Taurus.  The tertiary (outer) giant star overflows its Roche lobe at
pericenter.  We simulate the system using the AMUSE framework (see
[amusecode.org](http://www.amusecode.org)), using a combination of stellar evolution,
gravitational dynamics and hydrodynamics.  Reference to the scientific
paper: [2014MNRAS.438.1909D](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.438.1909D). The script
to simulate the evolution of this system can be downloaded from:
[http://www.amusecode.org/doc/examples/](http://old.amusecode.org/doc/examples/).

[![Star cluster simulation](http://img.youtube.com/vi/VF6J7P2cpn8/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF6J7P2cpn8 "Star cluster simulation")

Simulation of a star cluster starting from clumpy initial conditions. Includes the effect of mass loss from the stellar evolution. Simulated using AMUSE. Rendered as you would see it with the Hubble Space Telescope, if it would snap a picture every 31250 year, that is!


[![pythagorean problem solved with brutus and hermite](http://img.youtube.com/vi/hjVDGM7m6PA/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVDGM7m6PA "pythagorean problem solved with brutus and hermite")

Evolution of the Pythagorean triple system of 3 objects with relative
masses 3, 4 and 5, positioned on the corners of a triangle with
coordinates (1, 3), (-2, -1) and (1, -1) in the $(x, y)$ plane.  The
equations of motion have been integrated until the system dissolves
using two different integration methods.  The red stars are integrated
using a 4th order Hermite predictor corrector method (which conserves
energy to 1/10^11).  The black stars give the converged solution
(energy conservation better than 1/10^16) and with 3 decimal places
accurate irrespective of the time step or the length of the mantissa)
using the Brutus integrator (see
[2014ApJ...785L...3P](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...785L...3P)).  Both codes are
available via the AMUSE software environment at
[amusecode.org](http://www.amusecode.org).


[![Proto planetary disk around a binary star](http://img.youtube.com/vi/xrAINIHNynU/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrAINIHNynU "Proto planetary disk around a binary star")

Evolution of a proto-planetary disk around Kepler 16. Movie shows the evolution of a disk with a mass 0.01 solar masses around a binary system with stars of 0.7
and 0.2 solar mass. The simulations show that the location of density enhancement at the inner rim matches the current orbits of Kepler 16 and
similar systems, published in [2013MNRAS.429..895P](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.429..895P).

[How the Sun Captured Sedna](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015arXiv150603105J).

[![How the Sun Stole Sedna](http://img.youtube.com/vi/AQfl_5k_HaU/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQfl_5k_HaU "How the Sun Stole Sedna")

Animation of the encounter between the Sun (blue) and Q (red) both with planetesimal disks.
The Sun captures the Sednito's whereas Q captures some of the Sun's Kuiper belt objects.
Unbound objects turn gray.
The orbital elements (semi-major axis, eccentricity and inclination) are presented in the right panels.
The diamonds give the known Sednitos.

Simulate the windy S-stars in orbit around the Galactic center (see [2016MNRAS.456.3645L](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.456.3645L))
[![Stellar winds near massive black holes: The case of the S-stars.](http://img.youtube.com/vi/soGFgzRso3c/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soGFgzRso3c "Stellar winds near massive black holes: The case of the S-stars.")

Animation of the S-stars in orbit around the supermassive black hole in the Galactic center (in the middle of the animation).
The winds of the stars are turned on at the start of the movie, and develope a chaotic multi wind-shock region around the black hole, which accretes from the frothy wind.
You can also follow individual stars, such as for example S-66, S-67 and S-72:
