We are organizing an advanced workshop for AMUSE users at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. 
The meeting will be from Monday, April 22 to Friday, April 26, starting on Monday at 10am at the AMNH.
It will be held as an "unconference"/hackathon, as such there are no fixed slots for talks.

~As available places are limited, please let us know as soon as possible whether you will be able to participate.
Preference will be given to participants for whom travelling imposes a smaller carbon footprint.~

We plan to organize a similar meeting later this year in Europe.
